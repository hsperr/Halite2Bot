# Halite 2 Competition

My interest got sparked by the videos of Sentdex who introduced Halite 2 and a basic starter bot.
I improved upon that by adding features and reducing errors up until TheDorianV6.2 which brought me to rank ~400.
I think there is still a lot of room upwards with it but I got interested in a Vectorfield based approach. Vectorian is my try on implementing that, evenutally ending up beating my bot and bringing me to rank ~230. 
Although I tried as recommended to minimize the features by using LBFGS I actually selected those feature values by hand. Unfortunately games don't really run fast enough on my machine to do enough testing and searching. ~3sec/game.
